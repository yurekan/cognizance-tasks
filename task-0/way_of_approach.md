Installing Ubuntu in virtualbox

In the intial stage I was very much confused how to install Linux Ubuntu version 20.04 in my laptop. I was about to overwrite the OS on windows 10. And then I watched youtube
tutorials to clarify my doubts and get a clear idea how to install it in my laptop. Then after completing the tutorial I install vitualbox from the oracle website, and 
downloaded LTS version of Ubuntu.
